                <h1>Towards a zero electricity bill</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs with LEDs, got a new fridge and
                    super-efficient heat pump and you're still paying around $1200 a year?</p>
                <p>Your next step is to let HT Green work with you to design and install a system that uses solar, wind
                    or geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for now and into the future.</p>
