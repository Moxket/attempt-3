        <h1> Towards a zero electicity bill</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs with LEDs, got a new fridge and
            super-efficient heat pump and youre still paying around $1200 a year?</p>

        <p>Your next step is to let HT Green work with you to design and install a system that uses solar, wind or
            geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for now and into the future.

            <p> Solar Photovoltaic systems have come of age. Installers now can guarantee
                reliable cost-free power to your home or business.</p>
            <p>ROI is now taking less time than ever thanks to the ever decreasing equipment costs and better
                technology.
                If you have battery storage such as a Tesla Powerwall or similar Lithium Ion
                chemistry solutions then you can take your savings even further.</p>

            <div class="Images"><img src="HT-greens Pngs\Images\geo250.jpg" class="Images"></div>
            <P> Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than
                the air and we can use this to heat your home.</P>
            <p>HT Green can engineer a solution
                to fit your situation to give you free plentiful home warming energy year-round.
                Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but
                has previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate
                boundaries. </p>
            <p>Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the
                range and size of viable resources, especially for direct applications such as
                home heating.</p>
            <p>Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the
                earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels.
                As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming
                if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels</P>

            <div class="Images"><img src="HT-Greens Pngs\Images\turbine250.jpg" class="Images"></div>
            <p> If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to engineer a
                wind turbine system that generates electricity when the wind blows. Team a
                wind turbine with a solar PV system and you increase your energy generation
                potential. </p>

            <p>New to wind power? HT Green can show you more about how a wind turbine
                works, the benefits of wind energy and how a wind turbine is installed.</p>

            <p>If you're not sure on the type of turbine you need, before you buy from us,
                contact one of our wind power experts for the right advice</p>
