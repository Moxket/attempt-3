                <hr>
                <p>Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs with LEDs, got a new fridge and
                    super-efficient heat pump and you're still paying around $1200 a year?</p>
                <p>Your next step is to let HT Green work with you to design and install a system that uses solar, wind
                    or geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for now and into the future.</p>

                <p>Solar Photovoltaic systems have come of age. Installers now can guarantee reliable cost-free power to
                    your home or business.</p>
                <p>ROI is now taking less time than ever thanks to the ever-decreasing equipment costs and better
                    technology. If you have battery storage such as a Tesla Powerwall or similar Lithium Ion chemistry
                    solutions then you can take your savings even further.</p>

                <p>Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than the air and we can
                    use this to heat your home.</p>
                <p>HT Green can engineer a solution to fit your situation to give you free plentiful home warming energy
                    year-round.</p>
                <p>Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but has previously been
                    geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries.</p>
                <p>Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources,
                    especially for direct applications such as home heating.</p>
                <p>Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions
                    are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the
                    potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.</p>

                <p>If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to engineer a wind turbine system that
                    generates electricity when the wind blows. Team a wind turbine with a solar PV system and you
                    increase your energy generation potential.</p>
                <p>New to wind power? HT Green can show you more about how a wind turbine works, the benefits of wind
                    energy and how a wind turbine is installed.</p>
                <p>If you're not sure on the type of turbine you need, before you buy from us, contact one of our wind
                    power experts for the right advice.</p>
